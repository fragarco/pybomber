# Pybomber

A game where you have to destroy the buildings that block your plane. The game is being developed using Python 3 and Pygame 2.0.1

It's just a simple exercise to test Pygame and to remember Bomber, a classic BASIC program included in the Amstrad CPC464 programming manual.

## Building the project

It's encouraged to create a virtual environment for Python inside the checked out copy. Remember that Python version should be 3.7 or superior. You can create such environment through the following command:

```bash
python -m venv pyenv
```

Remember to activate your virtual environment before running the command to install all dependencies through **pip**.

Finally you can build the game using the script according to your system (buildwin.bat for Windows or buildmac.sh for macOS). The game should be generated inside **dist** folder.
